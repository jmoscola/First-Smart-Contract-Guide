# Introduction

This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough for developing a simple **"Hello World"** smart contract. The smart contract will be developed using the **_[Remix Online IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)_** and programmed in **_[Solidity](https://soliditylang.org)_**. It will then be deployed onto the **_[Flare Network](https://flare.network/)_** with the assistance of a common Web3 wallet, **_[MetaMask](https://metamask.io)_**.


While the **"Hello World"** smart contract is a fairly common beginner's example, the version presented in this guide adds a few extra features to explore some additional smart contract capabilities.
