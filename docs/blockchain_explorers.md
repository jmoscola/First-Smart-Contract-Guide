# Blockchain Explorers

Most blockchains provide full transparency which means you can view all the transactions that occur on the blockchain. Typically, this information is available via a **_Blockchain Explorer_**. A Blockchain Explorer is simply a website that presents blockchain activity in a user-friendly and easy-to-read format. MetaMask provides a convenient shortcut for visiting Blockchain Explorers as described below.
