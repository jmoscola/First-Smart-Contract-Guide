# Acquiring Testnet Tokens

As noted previously, testnet tokens are distinct from their _mainnet_ counterparts and hold no real-world value. These testnet tokens can be acquired for free from distribution services called **_faucets_**.  You may have noticed the URL for the **Coston2** faucet when viewing the **_Flare Network_** settings [here](https://docs.flare.network/dev/reference/network-config/).

## Visit the Coston2 Faucet

1. You'll need to provide the address of your **_Flare Network_** account to the faucet so the faucet knows where to send the testnet tokens. You can easily copy your address into your clipboard by clicking on the address in MetaMask as shown in the image below.
